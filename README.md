The code is a classical rock-paper-scissors-game.

1 stands for rock
2 stands for paper
3 stands for scissors

The computers picks one of these three numbers randomly. The user then is aked to pick a number:

1 (rock) beats 3 (scissors)
2 (paper) beats 1 (rock)
3 (scissors) beats 2 (paper)

If computer and user chose the same number it counts as a tie. For every win the computer or the user gain 1 point. The score is then presented.
